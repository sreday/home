It’s powerful stuff … but when you combine it with observability (the ability to understand the inner workings of your complex systems and other unknown-unknowns), what you get is a supercharged, superpowered version of both.
With observability and feature flags, you and your teams get deep technical and business insights in real time about how your code is working, what changed with your last deploy, and how changes are impacting different users, apps, or groups.",,

My name is Ondrej, and I am passionate about almost everything related to IT. I spend most of my free time watching, fixing, or driving cars, so we will have a lot to talk about if you are a car or bike person.

Besides that, I have a beard and am pretty tall, so I suppose I am easy to find. I am open to conversing with anyone, learning something new, or giving anybody some advice.

## Career
I have been working in **Red Hat** as a Senior Quality Engineer and Team Lead for almost 6 years now on various projects: 
* Enmasse 
* PatrIoT 
* Apicurio Registry
* Debezium

Currently, I have two main projects that I am interested in:
* **[Debezium project](https://github.com/debezium)**, which I find very interesting, and I love working with the whole community around it. 
* **[Skodjob project](https://github.com/skodjob)**: this project was created some years ago by my colleagues David Kornel and Jakub Stejskal. It contains various tooling for long-running test environments on the Openshift environment and database performance tooling.

Other than that, I am still trying to find time to work on some of my older projects, like Rust MQTT, the first Async Rust MQTT client for embedded devices at the time."
